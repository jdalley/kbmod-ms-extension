==================

Chrome Extension for working with Twitch TV and KBMOD's MultiStream tool (www.kbmod.com/multistream)

All KBMOD MultiStream code reference/influence and icon usage belongs to KBMOD - www.kbmod.com.

This tool is intended to provide a few shortcuts for those who still use the main Twitch TV 
website, but would like to quickly and easily switch to KBMOD MultiStream from either a single
channel (via hyperlink context menu), or up to 6 channels via the Extension button popup.

This is a rough version and I'll likely come back and implement enhancements soon.
